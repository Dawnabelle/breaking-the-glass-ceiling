Wonder what the current COVID-19 situation means for PDXWIT, an organization where coming together in person feels foundational? Join Kimberly and Dawn as they interview Hazel Valdez and Elizabeth Stock, PDXWIT's Operations Manager and Executive Director, to explore what changes the community can expect, both short and long term. And how we can still  enjoy what we love about this community in new formats as we navigate this new normal, apart together.
